# ABS System Effect on Minor League ⚾

The Automatic Ball-Strike challenge system will be intorduced to MLB in the 2026 season. This system represents one of the most significant changes to the strike zone in league history. Unlike the fully automated strike zone, the challenge system allows umpires to call balls and strikes as usual, but gives players and managers the ability to challenge a limited number of calls per game. When a challenge is made, the call is reviewed in real-time using Hawk-Eye tracking technology, and the call is either confirmed or overturned. To prepare for league-wide adoption, MLB has been testing both the full ABS system and the challenge-based hybrid system in the minor leagues since 2021, including at the Triple-A, Double-A, and Low-A levels. 

This project aims to analyze the effects of the ABS Challenge System using pitch-by-pitch (PBP) data from minor league games over the past two seasons from Triple-A.
